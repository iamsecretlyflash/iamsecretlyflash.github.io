      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-why&#34;&gt;Just Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that needs to be addressed is why I decided to make this website. Why did I spend the entirety of 19th January 2025 figuring out how to host this goddamn webpage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons are threefold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have lately realized I love to yap, have tons of thoughts, and would love a place to pen (type) them down (hence the blog).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have always been somewhat obsessed with the idea of having a domain name for myself. I splurged a bit today and therefore had to add content to the page with my nameâ€”what better than random thoughts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have to thank Aniruddha Deb for the idea of hosting a blog page using Hugo. I have always enjoyed reading his blogs and was inspired by him to create something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will see that the theme of this page is inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aniruddhadeb.com&#34;&gt;Aniruddha&amp;rsquo;s page&lt;/a&gt; because I found Hugo through his blog and used some style elements from his GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
